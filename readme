The simulation cannot be submitted automatically, but nothing else needs to be changed. The scripts will take care of everything by themselves.
The following caution should be considered unless something went wrong.

If one simulation was killed, delete the output folder corresponding to the simulation job number to rerun it.
If one needed to keep the data related to the killed job, log file and sim.job.restart.tcl file will need to be updated for the new simulation. "sim3.log"
has to be changed to sim3_"simulation job Number".log

For submmiting, the first job use regular slurm command, but for the other jobs dependency, slurm is essential: 
qsub -W depend=afterany:'last job_ID' sim_ext.pbs

sim.job.restart.tcl file in the main directory must be checked after each simulation for any inconsistency.
